# The handwritten asm on the PC port

About a third of hd_code (us.v11 `0x56040`–`0x8E910`, 31 objects, 688
functions, 55k instructions) and hd_front_end's `0x1B100` run are Rare's
handwritten MIPS. It can't become matching C, so the port runs a mechanical
translation of it first (ROADMAP, Phase 5). This is that translator, and the
test that shows it's right.

## Approach

Our own translator over the symbolic `.s` files, in `tools/recomp/`, rather
than N64Recomp over the linked ELF:

- **Symbols survive.** Splat's `.s` already names every address (`%hi(D_…)`,
  `jal func_…`, `.L` labels), so the C says `SYM(D_803A7410)`, not
  `0x803A7410`. Its address comes from a generated header, so it follows the
  shiftable build and, later, wherever the port puts the variable. N64Recomp
  works from relocations and emits addresses.
- **It sees exactly the code we classified.** The set of objects comes from
  the `asm` subsegments in `hd_code.us.v11.yaml` (minus libultra's). It isn't
  a whole-ELF pass, so the decompiled C is never pulled in again, and the data
  islands inside `.text` are never mistaken for code.
- **Rare's code is simple to translate.** Every `jr` is `jr $ra`, and there is
  no `jalr`, no `j`, no jump table and no function pointer into it (none in
  the data, none in the islands). Control flow is branches and `jal`, which
  become `goto` and direct C calls. The only irregular spots are one
  branch into another function's epilogue (`func_8029CB04` into
  `func_8029CF04`), handled by merging those functions into one C body with an
  entry switch, and 19 branches into delay slots.
- **Small and deterministic.** It is about 1,100 lines of Python with no
  dependencies, and it gives the same output for the same input.

The instructions are decoded from the word in each line's comment
(`tools/recomp/mips.py`), not from the mnemonic text, and cross-checked
against the text. Only the symbolic operands come from the text.

## Interface

```c
typedef struct recomp_context {
    union { uint64_t r[32]; struct { uint64_t zero, at, v0, v1, a0, ... ra; }; };
    uint64_t hi, lo;
    uint32_t f[32];        /* COP1, Status.FR = 0 as the game runs it */
    uint32_t fcr31;
    int64_t budget;        /* test only */
} recomp_context;

void recomp_func_8029A800(uint8_t *rdram, recomp_context *ctx);
```

- **State.** All of it is N64 state. The registers live in `ctx`, 64 bits
  wide. Memory is reached by 32-bit N64 addresses: `rdram + (addr &
  0x1FFFFFFF)` for KSEG0 and KSEG1. The translated code never holds a host
  pointer, and one `ctx` per game thread carries `$gp`/`$sp` between calls.
- **Addresses** are `SYM(name)` (`syms_<module>.h`, generated from the linked
  ELF). A port that places data elsewhere redefines those, as long as each
  datum is still inside the arena that `rdram` points at.
- **Calls into translated code** (IDO C calls 167 of the 688 functions by
  name): set `a0`–`a3` (and `$sp` into the arena, since the functions build
  frames there) in the thread's context, call `recomp_func_X(rdram, ctx)`,
  and read `v0`. Many of these functions also take arguments in
  `v0`/`v1`/`t*`/`s0`, and the wrapper for each one has to set those, so the
  wrappers are hand-written as the C callers get decompiled. No function
  pointer reaches this code, but `recomp_lookup(addr)` (`funcs.c`) resolves
  one if that ever changes.
- **Calls out of translated code** (53 callees: IDO C and libultra) go
  through `recomp_extern_<name>(rdram, ctx)`. The generated default
  (`externs.c`) forwards to `recomp_call_external(rdram, ctx, SYM(name))`.
  The port replaces each one with glue that unpacks `a0`–`a3` (and stack
  arguments at `sp+0x10`), converts address arguments with `rdram + (a &
  0x1FFFFFFF)`, calls the native function, and puts the result in `v0`.
- **Hooks the embedder provides:** `recomp_trap` (break/syscall, which are
  Rare's asserts, plus faults in the test build), `recomp_call_external`, and
  `recomp_mfc0`/`recomp_mtc0` (one Status read and one Compare write).
- **Memory layout.** By default memory is a byte-exact big-endian image (what
  the ROM's data is), and every access byte-swaps on the host. That is what
  the test verifies. `-DRECOMP_NATIVE_ENDIAN` switches to host-order words for
  a port whose native C shares those structs. Words, halves and bytes then
  read the same from both sides, but `lwl`/`lwr`/`swl`/`swr` (32 uses) and
  anything that reads one datum at two widths would need checking. Doubles
  and `ld`/`sd` are two words, high word first, in both modes.

So the port runs decompiled C with host pointers, and the engine runs inside
an emulated 4 MB (or larger) RDRAM arena. Data the two share has to live in
that arena. The game already allocates from a heap at `0x803FF600`, and its
globals can be placed there by the port's linker or loader. Crossing between
the two sides goes through the glue above. That covers 167 call sites in and
53 callees out, few enough to write and check by hand.

## Semantics worth knowing

These are the choices where the VR4300, the MIPS spec and QEMU disagree, or
where the obvious C is wrong:

- **`sra`/`srav`** shift the whole 64-bit register and sign-extend the low
  word. Rare does this after `dmult`/`mflo`, so it matters for fixed point.
  QEMU leaves such inputs unextended; the test build follows QEMU there
  (`RECOMP_QEMU_COMPAT`).
- **FR = 0.** Doubles and 64-bit integers are even/odd pairs, and the code
  builds a double with `mtc1 $at, $f9`. The L-format conversions (`cvt.s.l`,
  `cvt.d.l`, `cvt.l.s`, `cvt.l.d`, 44 uses) are legal on the VR4300 with FR =
  0. QEMU rejects them, so the test harness executes those itself.
- **Float to int** out of range or NaN gives `0x7FFFFFFF`/`0x7FFF…F`. `cvt`
  rounds to nearest-even (the FCSR mode the game leaves), with
  `-ffp-contract=off` so nothing fuses.
- **NaNs** follow MIPS legacy encoding: a quiet NaN operand propagates, and a
  signaling NaN or an invalid operation gives `0x7FBFFFFF`. `abs`/`neg`/`mov`
  only touch bits. The FCSR's flag and cause bits aren't kept; nothing but
  libultra's thread switch reads them.
- **`add`/`addi`/`sub`/`dadd`** trap on overflow in the test build and wrap
  in the port. The game never overflows them, since that would crash on
  hardware.
- **Divide by zero** gives the VR4300's result (`LO = n<0 ? 1 : -1`,
  `HI = n`), or QEMU's in the test build. The code only reaches it on paths
  that then `break 7`.

## Running it

```
make -C tools/recomp                  # translate -> blastcorps/build/recomp/src
make -C tools/recomp port             # compile it as the port would (-Werror)
make -C tools/recomp snapshots        # optional: RDRAM from real play (mupen64plus)
make -C tools/recomp test PYTHON=.env/bin/python TRIALS=100
```

These need a built us.v11 stage 2, because the translator reads
`blastcorps/asm/` and `blastcorps/build/*.elf`. The test needs `numpy` and
`unicorn` in the venv. `tools/recomp/analyze.py` prints the opcode
inventory and any control flow the translator would refuse (there is none
now).

### The differential test (`tools/recomp/test/difftest.py`)

Each translated function runs many trials, and each trial does this:

1. Build 4 MB of RDRAM from the linked `hd_code`, `hd_front_end` and `init`
   images, plus one of these fills:
   - one of 8 seeded random fills, mostly zeros, small integers, floats and
     pointers back into RDRAM;
   - one of 16 snapshots of real play. `test/snapshot.c` is a headless
     mupen64plus front-end that is its own scripted input plugin. It plays
     through the title, the name entry, Simian Acres, the pause menu and the
     world map. A snapshot keeps the linked `.text` on top.
2. Randomize the registers the same way. Registers the function
   dereferences before writing them get pointers, taken from pointer-looking
   words of the snapshot when there is one. Words that the code loads from a
   symbol and then dereferences are also given pointers.
3. Run the original in unicorn (MIPS64 big-endian, R4000 model, FR = 0) until
   it returns, traps, or uses up its budget of 400k instructions.
4. Reset memory and run the translated C, built into a shared library with
   `RECOMP_TEST`, on the same state. Calls out of it run the original callee
   in unicorn on the same buffer. So everything that isn't translated
   executes identically in both runs, which is also why `hd_code`'s C doesn't
   need to be available as C here. A second pass (`--stub-externs`) makes
   every callee return a hash of its arguments in both runs instead, which
   gets further into code whose callees fault on random state.
5. Compare all GPRs, HI/LO, all 32 FPR words, the FCSR condition bit, every
   byte of RDRAM, and how the run ended (return, break, syscall, overflow,
   or address fault). Code pages are write-protected in both runs, so
   random pointers can't rewrite instructions that only the original would
   then execute.

A trial where either side hit the budget is inconclusive. So is one where
the random state overwrote the saved `$ra` (the translated code refuses to
return anywhere but its caller). `--trace FUNC:TRIAL` with the
`librecomp_trace.so` build (`make trace-lib`) replays one trial with a
per-instruction register trace on both sides and prints where they diverge.

### Results (100 trials per function, with snapshots)

- **688/688 functions pass.** Across both passes, 0 of about 137,000 trials
  differ.
- 548 functions returned normally in at least one trial, and 584 when
  callees are stubbed. The other 104 only ever faulted or trapped,
  identically on both sides, which still compares state up to the fault.
  100 of those dereference a register or global that neither the random
  state nor the snapshots make valid: 62 null or small-integer pointers and
  38 other bad addresses. Of the last four, one always overflows, one
  always faults on alignment, one always runs past the budget, and one is
  an assert (`syscall`, hd_front_end's `func_80202100`) that always fires.
- Coverage of the translated code, over both passes: 69.4% of basic blocks
  (6385 of 9203) and 75.7% of instructions executed at least once. All 102
  opcodes the code uses are executed.
- Mutation check: of 11 bugs planted in the runtime or the translator (slti
  signedness, sra as logical, `lb` zero-extending, `cvt.w.s` truncating,
  mult HI/LO swapped, dmult HI dropped, `c.le` as `c.lt`, `lwr` shift,
  `swl` bytes, branch condition read after the delay slot), the test catches
  10, each with 2 to 188 failing functions. The eleventh, `lwl` keeping the
  wrong low bytes, is masked by the code: every `lwl` is paired with an
  `lwr` that overwrites those bytes.

What this can't test:

- Code that reads hardware or needs another thread (libultra's message
  queues) only gets as far as its first fault in these runs.
- The other 30% of the blocks were never reached. Getting there
  needs realistic arguments, not only realistic memory.
- Undefined-behaviour cases where QEMU and the VR4300 differ (`sra` on
  unextended values, divide by zero) are checked against QEMU's behaviour in
  the test build. The port build's VR4300 behaviour for them is not
  exercised.

## What's left for the port

- **Real call states.** Recording `ctx` and memory at each translated
  function's entry during play would replace the random registers. That
  needs a debugger-enabled mupen64plus core or a breakpoint hook, and it
  would reach the 30% of blocks that the random states don't.
- **Glue.** Write the 53 extern wrappers and the entry wrappers for the 167
  C call sites. Each entry wrapper must know which registers the Rare
  function takes.
- **The arena.** Put the game's shared globals and its heap in the RDRAM
  arena, and decide between big-endian and native-endian storage for data
  the native C touches.
- **Not translated:** `init`'s boot code and libultra's `.s` files (exception
  vectors, TLB, cache and thread switching). The platform layer replaces
  them. `recomp_mfc0`/`mtc0` stand in for the two COP0 accesses in Rare's
  code.
- **Readable C.** Replace translated functions with hand-written C one at a
  time. Each replacement can be checked with the same harness: point the
  test library at the new C instead of the generated file.
