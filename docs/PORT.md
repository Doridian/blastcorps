# The PC port

The PC build (`port/`, milestone 1 of ROADMAP Phase 5) and the translator
it runs Rare's handwritten asm through.  The build is described first; the
translator and its test follow from "The handwritten asm".

## Building and running

```
make VERSION=us.v11 -C blastcorps          # the N64 build: the port reads its ELFs and asm/
make -C tools/recomp                       # translate the handwritten engine
cmake -S port -B build/port -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=clang \
      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++ -DCMAKE_ASM_COMPILER=clang
cmake --build build/port
build/port/blastcorps baserom.us.v11.z64   # the user's own ROM
```

It needs clang/LLVM with its development headers (BEPass is an LLVM
plugin), a 32-bit (multilib) libc and SDL2, and Python 3; the OpenGL
renderer also needs 32-bit libepoxy and an OpenGL 3.3 driver (without
libepoxy only the software renderer is built).  Keys: arrows or
WASD for the stick, X = A, C = B, Z = Z, Enter = Start, Q/E = L/R, IJKL = C
buttons, TFGH = D-pad; an SDL game controller works too.  `--help` lists
the options: `--headless`, `--deterministic` (virtual time: as fast as the
host can, identical every run), `--frames N`, `--screenshot PREFIX`,
`--save PATH` (the 4 Kbit EEPROM, default `blastcorps.eep`; runs meant to
be compared should each start from the same one, or none),
`--renderer gl|sw` (default: OpenGL with a window, software headless),
`--scale N` (OpenGL: render at 320x240 times N; by default it follows the
window's height, so resizing the window changes it) and
`--filter n64|bilinear|point` (textures: the N64's 3-point filter where
the game asks for bilinear filtering, which is the default, a 4-tap
bilinear one, or point sampling throughout), `--wav PATH` (everything the game plays, at the AI's rate) and `--no-audio`; sound goes
to SDL unless the run is `--headless` or `--deterministic`.
`PORT_AUTOSTART=1` taps Start and A, which is enough to get from the title
through the name entry into Simian Acres (`=2` taps by the game's own
retrace count and then drives forward in the level, as
`port/tools/m64p_pace.c` does in mupen64plus); `PORT_DUMP=N,...` writes RDRAM at
the Nth controller read, counted as `tools/recomp/test/snapshot.c` counts
them in mupen64plus, so the two can be compared byte for byte.
`PORT_SHOT_EVERY=N` saves a screenshot every N frames (at the internal
resolution with OpenGL); `PORT_GL_QUANT=1` makes the OpenGL renderer write
5-bit color, as the RDRAM framebuffer holds it, and `PORT_GL_READBACK=1`
copies its framebuffers back to RDRAM after every task (see "Graphics").
`PORT_PACE=FILE` logs the pacing at every controller read (see "Timing").

## Memory model

The decompiled C, the translated asm, the game's data and whatever the ROM
holds all have to agree on memory.  The port keeps the N64's view of it
exactly, and adapts the host to that, rather than the other way round:

- **32-bit addresses.**  The whole program is a 32-bit x86 program
  (`-m32 -malign-double`), so a pointer is 4 bytes and every struct has its
  N64 layout.  The executable is linked at `0x80400000`.
- **RDRAM at `0x80000000`.**  The first 4 MB of the address space is the
  image's `.rdram` section (`tools/gen_ld.py`), so a KSEG0 address *is* the
  host address.  The translated code's `rdram + (addr & 0x1FFFFFFF)` with
  `rdram = 0x80000000` is the identity; `K0_TO_PHYS`, `PHYS_TO_K0`,
  `osVirtualToPhysical` and segment addresses round-trip; the game's fixed
  buffers (framebuffers at `0x80000400`, the level pool from `0x8004B400`,
  the heap after `.bss` at `0x803FF600`) are where it expects them.  The
  hardware registers (`0xA4000000`) are mapped as plain memory, and the
  fibers' host stacks sit at `0x90000000`, inside the KSEG0 window, so the
  address of a local means the same to the translated code.
- **Every game variable at its N64 address.**  The decompiled C relies on
  the layout of the data, not just its contents: code reads fields through
  names of their own (other files read the scheduler's frame counter,
  `Sched.frameCount`, as `D_803156C4`), tables are indexed from a
  neighbour, the front end's area is cleared by address.  The game's C is
  built with `-fdata-sections`, the data files are converted one section per
  file (`tools/asm2x86.py`), and `gen_ld.py` places each at its address in
  the N64 link; the build checks all 3,937 symbols afterwards.  Anything in
  RDRAM the port doesn't define is simply there, at its N64 address
  (`tools/gen_syms.py`).
- **Big-endian memory.**  The data files, the ROM's assets and most of the
  C-owned data are untyped bytes: a native little-endian reading would need
  every structure typed first (Phase 3/4).  Instead the game's C is compiled
  by clang with **BEPass** (`port/bepass/`), an LLVM pass that byte-swaps
  every multi-byte load and store, so memory holds exactly the N64's bytes.
  Type punning, unions, `u64` halves, reading a struct from the ROM: all
  behave as on the N64.  The translated asm stays in its tested big-endian
  mode, and DMA is a plain copy.  Initialized data is fixed at startup: the
  pass records the scalars in C initializers and a constructor swaps them
  (`__bepass_fixup`), and symbolic `.word`s in the data files are listed in
  a `port_bswap32` section and swapped by `port_fixups()`.  Swaps on locals
  fold away; what's left costs a `bswap` or `movbe`.  Only code built with
  the pass is on the "N64 side"; host code (`port/host/`) that touches game
  memory does so through `port_be32()` and friends (`port/include/port.h`).
  Functions that use `va_start` are left unswapped (the argument area is
  the host's); the game's are empty debug printfs, and `sprintf` is the
  host's `vsprintf`.
- **Why this and not native pointers.**  It is the quickest way to run the
  code as it is: no data needs typing, the translated engine is used exactly
  as tested, and the game's own assumptions about addresses hold.  The path
  to a clean port stays open and is incremental: as structures get typed
  (Phase 3) and assets get loaders that swap and widen them (Phase 4),
  BEPass and `-m32` go away together; the translated code has a native-endian
  mode (`RECOMP_NATIVE_ENDIAN`) for then, and every place the port depends
  on the layout is a symbol or a documented fixed address.

BEPass also puts a call to `__port_poll()` on every loop back edge.  The
game busy-waits on counters that another thread or an interrupt advances
(`while (D_803156C4 - sp60 < 15) {}` waits for retraces); the port runs its
threads one at a time, and the poll is where it lets a due event in.  As an
opaque call it also stops clang from hoisting the load out of the loop, as
IDO never would.

## The platform layer

- **Threads** (`port/host/threads.c`): each OSThread is a fiber (ucontext) on
  the one OS thread, scheduled as libultra does: the highest-priority
  runnable thread runs until it blocks, yields, or wakes a thread of higher
  priority.  The idle thread parks when it drops to priority 0.  Each thread
  has its own `recomp_context`, whose `$sp` is the N64 stack the game gave
  `osCreateThread` (only the translated code uses it).
- **The loop** (`port/host/main.c`) runs when no thread can: it raises the
  events the hardware would (VI retrace at 60 Hz, timers, PI, SP and DP task
  completion) and sleeps until the next one, or until a busy thread's work
  is done (see "Timing").
- **libultra** (`port/src/ultra.c`, N64 side): messages, events, timers,
  `osGetTime` from the host clock (at 46.875 MHz), PI DMA from the ROM
  file, the controller from SDL, EEPROM to a file, no Controller Pak, VI
  swap, SP tasks, the RDP's freeze bit, AI (`port/host/audio.c`).  The
  waits libultra itself does are kept: `osContInit`'s half second after
  power-on, `osEepromLongWrite`'s 12 ms per block.  The stubs of `src/` that include only
  libultra's os/io (and libc's printf and string functions) aren't built;
  gu, libaudio and the rest of libc are.  hd_code's entry point
  (`func_802447C0`) runs on a boot thread (`port/src/boot.c`).
- **The overlay** (`port/src/overlay.c`): the front end is linked in, and
  "loading" it (`func_8028B3E0`, wrapped at link time) restores its `.data`
  from a startup copy and clears its `.bss`, which is what the N64's inflate
  leaves behind.  It runs the N64's DMA and inflate first, into the same
  memory, for the time they take.
- **Graphics**: see "Graphics" below.
- **Audio**: the game's audio thread and libaudio run, the audio task goes
  through an HLE of the audio microcode, and the AI plays it through SDL
  (see "Audio").

## Timing

How the game paces itself, and what the port does about each part:

- **Retraces.**  The scheduler (`hd_code/2C560.c`, a variant of the SDK's
  sample `sched.c`) gets a message every retrace (`osViSetEvent(..., 1)`)
  and counts them (`sc->unk284`, i.e. `D_803156C4`, which the game's own
  waits read).  The VI is raised at 60 Hz, as mupen64plus does.
- **The swap.**  When a frame's RDP work is done (OS_EVENT_DP), the
  scheduler swaps at once if a retrace has gone by since the last swap
  showed, or if `D_80364A90` (the game mode) is one of the front-end modes
  in `0xC9FD0FE79BFF80B0`; otherwise it holds the frame to the next
  retrace.  After a swap it freezes the RDP (`DPC_SET_FREEZE`) and thaws it
  at the retrace that shows the new frame.  The port keeps the freeze: a
  full sync that comes while frozen is held until the thaw.  That is what
  keeps the intro modes at one frame per retrace (they ran about 15 times
  too fast without it) and gameplay at two.
- **The game's frame** waits for its task's done message
  (`func_80285110`), and in the levels for the texture DMAs of the frame.
  How long a frame takes is then the CPU's time, which on the port is
  charged, not spent: the translated engine counts the MIPS instructions it
  executes (the translator's `BB()` per basic block, built with
  `RECOMP_COUNT`), the game's C counts its optimised IR instructions
  (BEPass's second pass, ICount, into `__port_icount_c`), and libultra's
  own work that the port doesn't run is charged at rough fixed costs
  (`COST_*` in `port.h`, and the copies in `port/src/libc.c`).  At each
  call into libultra the running thread is charged for what it did since
  (`host_cpu_sync`, `port/host/threads.c`), at mupen64plus's CountPerOp = 2
  (42.7 ns an instruction; `PORT_COUNT_PER_OP` changes it, 0 turns the model
  off) and 1.6 MIPS instructions per IR instruction for the C
  (`PORT_C_SCALE`; IDO's `-O1` code is bigger than clang's `-O2`).  A
  thread that is ahead of the clock goes "busy": it holds the CPU against
  lower priorities, higher ones preempt it (and push its end back), and
  `--deterministic` jumps its virtual clock through it.
- **The RDP** is instant, as in mupen64plus.  The renderer's estimate of
  its time (`host_charge`) delays OS_EVENT_DP by that much times
  `PORT_RDP_SCALE` (default 0).  It used to advance `--deterministic`'s
  clock directly, which stalled every thread, VI included.
- **PI DMA** completes at mupen64plus's rate for the cartridge (a count tick
  per 8 bytes), one transfer after another.  **Audio** is paced by the AI
  (see "Audio").  `osGetTime`/`osGetCount` are the same clock; the game uses
  them for profiling and for random seeds.

Measured against mupen64plus 2.6 (rsp-hle, rice), with
`port/tools/m64p_pace.c` (a headless front end that logs the same things
the port's `PORT_PACE=FILE` does: at each controller read, the scheduler's
retrace count, the mode and the samples played) and
`port/tools/pace_cmp.py`, both from no save, `--deterministic`:

| mode (D_80364A90)            | port: retraces a frame | mupen64plus |
| ---                          | ---                    | ---         |
| N64 logo (0x10), 250 frames  | 1.01                   | 1.00        |
| Rare logo (0x20), 250 frames | 1.30                   | 1.27        |
| title and intro story (0x2)  | 2.31, 2.61, 2.43       | 2.34, 2.69, 2.47 |
| "leaders of" screens (1<<48) | 1.14, 1.11             | 1.13, 1.10  |
| world map (0x4000)           | 3.45                   | 3.51        |
| Simian Acres, driving (0x4)  | 2.00 (30 fps)          | 2.00        |

The title comes up at retrace 639 (mupen64plus: 617), and the attract
sequence's fourth mode change is at 9802 (9937).  Before, the logos took
11 retraces for their 250 frames and gameplay ran at a frame a retrace.
In real time the pace is the same, except where the host's own work (the
software renderer, above all) doesn't fit in the time the model gives it:
the intro story ran about 3% slower than `--deterministic` here.
`--deterministic` stays identical from run to run.

## Audio

- **The microcode** (`port/host/aspmain.c`): the audio task's command list
  runs at `osSpTaskStartGo`.  This game's libaudio is older than
  ultralib's (`src/libultra/audio`), and so is its microcode: the sixteen
  commands of PR/abi.h, with a linear envelope (env.c's `_getRate` is a
  straight line, the rate a step per eight samples).  ADPCM (with the loop
  state), the 4-tap resampler, the envelope mixer with its dry and wet
  sends, the mixer, interleave, load/save, DMEM moves, the reverb's
  one-pole filter.  It is written from what libaudio asks of each command
  and the SDK's description of the formats, not from another HLE (none was
  copied; mupen64plus-rsp-hle, which is GPL, was the reference it was
  compared against, only by output); the resampler's filter table is read
  from the microcode's own data in RDRAM (`D_8030EB90 + 0xD0`).
- **The AI** (`port/host/audio.c`): `osAiSetFrequency(22050)` gives the
  DAC divider libultra would (2208: 22047 Hz); the two-deep DMA queue drains
  at that rate on the same clock as the retraces and timers, so
  `osAiGetLength`, which the audio thread sizes each frame by, reads what it
  would on the hardware.  Each queued buffer goes to SDL (at 22048 Hz, at
  most 0.2 s queued) and to `--wav`.
- **Checked** against mupen64plus's own output (its rsp-hle runs the audio
  lists; `m64p_pace` is also its audio plugin and writes `audio.wav`): the
  attract music has the same RMS second by second, correlates 0.997-0.9998
  with it over half-second windows (the difference is -22 to -36 dB: a
  sub-sample timing offset and rounding), and gameplay's engine and
  destruction sounds correlate about 0.8-0.9 at a steady lag, with equal
  RMS.  Steady state the port plays 367.5 samples a retrace, what 22047 Hz
  at 60 Hz is.
- **What's approximate**: rounding in the envelope and mixer; the envelope
  state layout is the port's own (the game never reads it).  In real time
  SDL's device clock and the host clock drift apart slowly; the queue cap
  drops a buffer if the host fell far behind.

## Graphics

The RSP's graphics tasks are Fast3D (gbi 2.0D) display lists.
`port/host/gfx.c` is the front end both renderers share and the software
renderer; `port/host/gfx_gl.c` is the OpenGL 3.3 one; `gfx.h` is the
interface between them.

- **Front end** (RSP and RDP state): matrices, vertices, lighting,
  texgen, fog (into shade alpha, as the RSP does it; the game doesn't use
  it), clipping against the near plane, culling, `gSPModifyVertex` (the
  game rewrites texture coordinates with it: `G_MW_POINTS`), TMEM loads
  laid out as the RDP lays them out (the odd-row swizzle, which LoadBlock
  applies by counting `dxt` and the sampler undoes, and RGBA32 split
  across the two halves; the game's LoadBlock textures only look right with
  it), tiles, texel decoding for every format, level of detail (the tile
  pair and LOD_FRACTION from texels per pixel, which the terrain's
  mip-mapped 2-cycle mode uses), and the combiner and blender decoding.
  OS_EVENT_DP is raised only for a display list that ends in a full sync,
  as the game's scheduler expects.  The RDP's time is estimated from the
  geometry (the covered area), not from what a back end drew, so both
  renderers see the same timeline; it delays OS_EVENT_DP only when
  `PORT_RDP_SCALE` is set (see "Timing").
- **Software renderer**: draws into the game's color image in RDRAM, as
  the RDP would, and the VI shows RDRAM.  The combiner (both cycles), the
  blender (P * A + M * B over A + B, per cycle; without FORCE_BL the last
  cycle only passes the color, as full-coverage pixels do on the
  hardware), alpha compare and coverage-from-alpha, a float z-buffer tied to
  the z image (a fill rectangle into it clears it), N64 3-point filtering,
  8/16/32-bit color images.  It is the reference, and it runs headless.
- **OpenGL renderer**: the front end hands it clipped screen-space
  polygons and rectangles.  The game's two 320-wide 16-bit framebuffers
  become render targets at the internal resolution, sharing one depth
  buffer (the z image).  Textures are decoded from TMEM with the software
  renderer's own decoder, into the texels a tile can address, and cached by
  a hash of the TMEM bytes and parameters they come from; wrapping,
  mirroring, clamping, shifts, filtering and LOD are done in the shader
  with `texelFetch`, as the RDP does them, so they behave the same at any
  resolution.  Each combiner/blender mode compiles to a fragment shader
  (both cycles, alpha compare, coverage from alpha); the blender cycle that
  reads the framebuffer becomes the GL blend (ONE, SRC_ALPHA) with the
  source premultiplied, which gives (P * A + M * B) / (A + B) exactly for
  any P, M, A, B.  Triangles are batched per draw state.  The frame shown
  is the target the VI points at, scaled to the window with its aspect
  kept.
- **Where the game uses the framebuffer itself.**  Traced by write- and
  read-protecting the framebuffers between tasks (a SIGSEGV hook, not kept):
  the CPU never touches the two color framebuffers in the attract mode,
  the front end or Simian Acres.  The z image's memory (the start of
  `init`'s, `0x8021ED00`) is used by the gzip inflate as scratch while a
  level loads, which doesn't matter to either renderer.  What the game
  does render to texture is 64-wide 8-bit images at `0x803580C0`-
  `0x8035E240` (the soft shadows behind the text panels and under the
  vehicles), which it then loads as IA16 textures: the OpenGL renderer
  leaves every color image that isn't a 320-wide 16-bit one to the
  software rasterizer, in RDRAM, so those work unchanged.  A texture load
  from a GPU framebuffer (none happens) reads it back first;
  `PORT_GL_READBACK=1` also copies the framebuffers to RDRAM after every
  task, for code that reads them with the CPU.  A framebuffer the GPU never
  drew is shown from RDRAM.

Comparing the two (`--deterministic`, `PORT_SHOT_EVERY=150`, 1x, the attract
mode and 4,500 frames of `PORT_AUTOSTART=1` into Simian Acres): 0.01-0.02%
of pixels differ by more than 24 (of 255) in any channel, and the mean
difference is 2.9, which is the software renderer's 5-bit framebuffer
(1.5 with `PORT_GL_QUANT=1`, where what's left is translucent surfaces
blended with 5-bit or 8-bit memory).  Host time per graphics task (the
display list, the RSP work and the draw calls; about four tasks a frame),
Simian Acres: software 3.7 ms, OpenGL 0.42 ms, the same at 1x and 4x
since the GPU's work is asynchronous (a Radeon RX 7900 XTX).  4,500
deterministic frames take about 8 s with OpenGL at 4x against about 62 s
in software.  In real time both hold 60 frames a second; the process's CPU
use says little either way, since the game's threads spin on counters
while they wait for the retrace.

Not done: anti-aliasing (the coverage the blender uses on edges; rendering
above 1x and scaling down is the substitute) and the VI's filters, dither,
the combiner's noise and chroma key inputs, texgen from the look-at
vectors (the port uses the modelview's axes), the far plane (depth is
clamped instead), and triangle edges follow GL's and the software
renderer's pixel-center rule rather than the RDP's.

## The glue to the translated code

`port/tools/gen_glue.py` generates both directions from the C:

- `entry.c`: for each of the 167 translated functions the C calls, a native
  function with the C's prototype that puts the arguments where the o32 ABI
  does (`a0`-`a3`, `f12`/`f14` when the first argument is a float, the
  stack from `sp+16`, doubles and `u64`s as register pairs), calls
  `recomp_func_X` with the thread's context, and returns `v0` or `f0`.
- `externs.c`: `recomp_extern_X` for the 53 calls out, the reverse; it saves
  and restores the callee-saved registers around the native call, as the
  IDO-compiled callee would.

Prototypes come from the definition for a C function (K&R ones included)
and from the most common declaration for a translated one.
`port/tools/liveness.py` computes each translated function's live-in
registers; the generator checks the prototypes against them (no entry reads
an argument outside `a0`-`a3`/`f12`/`f14`) and lists disagreements in
`glue_report.txt`.

## Source changes for the port

Guarded with `#ifdef TARGET_PC`; the N64 build still matches.

- `hd_code/26570.c`: `func_8026BBD0` is `void`, but its callers use the
  result, which on the N64 is `v0` left over from `func_8026BCE0`; the port
  returns that.  Two string copies whose unsequenced `a[i] = b[i++]` IDO
  evaluates with the old index.
- `hd_code/168B0.c`: the same unsequenced copy.
- `tools/recomp/runtime/recomp.h`: `dmult`/`dmultu` without `__int128` on a
  32-bit host (checked against the `__int128` version).

## Status

- Boots, runs every thread, and plays the Rare logo, the title screen and
  the attract mode (the story sequence and the demo levels) for as long as
  it is left running; with Start/A it goes through the save-erase prompt,
  the name entry, the world map and into Simian Acres, which plays (the
  bulldozer, the carrier, the pause menu).
- Pacing matches mupen64plus to a few percent in every mode measured
  ("Timing"), and the music and sound effects play ("Audio").
- Known problems: the CPU's time is a model (instruction counts, a scale for
  the C, fixed costs for libultra), and the reference is mupen64plus, not
  the hardware: its CPU is CountPerOp = 2, its RDP instant.  The loading
  screens (the level's drop-in, 0x800) differ most: they are short and
  their frames are all loading.  The boot before hd_code (IPL3, init's
  inflate of hd_code) isn't run or charged; by the scheduler's count the
  N64 logo comes 14 retraces later than in mupen64plus and the title 22.
  Rendering: no anti-aliasing (see "Graphics").  Non-void functions that fall off the
  end (`func_8024B4B8`, `func_80271F48`, `func_8027E164`, `func_801F6160`,
  `func_801F61C8`, `func_801F6ED4`) return whatever the host leaves.

## What's left for the port

- **Timing.**  A better RDP estimate would let `PORT_RDP_SCALE` default to
  1; the C's instruction scale could come from IDO's actual code size per
  function instead of one number.
- **Real call states** for the translated code's test.  Recording `ctx` and
  memory at each translated function's entry during play would replace the
  random registers, and reach the 30% of blocks the random states don't.
- **Toward native code**: type the data (Phase 3), load assets through typed
  swapping loaders (Phase 4), then drop BEPass and `-m32` together and
  switch the translated code to `RECOMP_NATIVE_ENDIAN`.
- **Readable C.** Replace translated functions with hand-written C one at a
  time. Each replacement can be checked with the same harness: point the
  test library at the new C instead of the generated file.

# The handwritten asm

About a third of hd_code (us.v11 `0x56040`–`0x8E910`, 31 objects, 688
functions, 55k instructions) and hd_front_end's `0x1B100` run are Rare's
handwritten MIPS. It can't become matching C, so the port runs a mechanical
translation of it first (ROADMAP, Phase 5). This is that translator, and the
test that shows it's right.

## Approach

Our own translator over the symbolic `.s` files, in `tools/recomp/`, rather
than N64Recomp over the linked ELF:

- **Symbols survive.** Splat's `.s` already names every address (`%hi(D_…)`,
  `jal func_…`, `.L` labels), so the C says `SYM(D_803A7410)`, not
  `0x803A7410`. Its address comes from a generated header, so it follows the
  shiftable build and, later, wherever the port puts the variable. N64Recomp
  works from relocations and emits addresses.
- **It sees exactly the code we classified.** The set of objects comes from
  the `asm` subsegments in `hd_code.us.v11.yaml` (minus libultra's). It isn't
  a whole-ELF pass, so the decompiled C is never pulled in again, and the data
  islands inside `.text` are never mistaken for code.
- **Rare's code is simple to translate.** Every `jr` is `jr $ra`, and there is
  no `jalr`, no `j`, no jump table and no function pointer into it (none in
  the data, none in the islands). Control flow is branches and `jal`, which
  become `goto` and direct C calls. The only irregular spots are one
  branch into another function's epilogue (`func_8029CB04` into
  `func_8029CF04`), handled by merging those functions into one C body with an
  entry switch, and 19 branches into delay slots.
- **Small and deterministic.** It is about 1,100 lines of Python with no
  dependencies, and it gives the same output for the same input.

The instructions are decoded from the word in each line's comment
(`tools/recomp/mips.py`), not from the mnemonic text, and cross-checked
against the text. Only the symbolic operands come from the text.

## Interface

```c
typedef struct recomp_context {
    union { uint64_t r[32]; struct { uint64_t zero, at, v0, v1, a0, ... ra; }; };
    uint64_t hi, lo;
    uint32_t f[32];        /* COP1, Status.FR = 0 as the game runs it */
    uint32_t fcr31;
    int64_t budget;        /* test only */
} recomp_context;

void recomp_func_8029A800(uint8_t *rdram, recomp_context *ctx);
```

- **State.** All of it is N64 state. The registers live in `ctx`, 64 bits
  wide. Memory is reached by 32-bit N64 addresses: `rdram + (addr &
  0x1FFFFFFF)` for KSEG0 and KSEG1. The translated code never holds a host
  pointer, and one `ctx` per game thread carries `$gp`/`$sp` between calls.
- **Addresses** are `SYM(name)` (`syms_<module>.h`, generated from the linked
  ELF). A port that places data elsewhere redefines those, as long as each
  datum is still inside the arena that `rdram` points at.
- **Calls into translated code** (IDO C calls 167 of the 688 functions by
  name): set `a0`–`a3` (and `$sp` into the arena, since the functions build
  frames there) in the thread's context, call `recomp_func_X(rdram, ctx)`,
  and read `v0`. Many of these functions also take arguments in
  `v0`/`v1`/`t*`/`s0`, and the wrapper for each one has to set those, so the
  wrappers are hand-written as the C callers get decompiled. No function
  pointer reaches this code, but `recomp_lookup(addr)` (`funcs.c`) resolves
  one if that ever changes.
- **Calls out of translated code** (53 callees: IDO C and libultra) go
  through `recomp_extern_<name>(rdram, ctx)`. The generated default
  (`externs.c`) forwards to `recomp_call_external(rdram, ctx, SYM(name))`.
  The port replaces each one with glue that unpacks `a0`–`a3` (and stack
  arguments at `sp+0x10`), converts address arguments with `rdram + (a &
  0x1FFFFFFF)`, calls the native function, and puts the result in `v0`.
- **Hooks the embedder provides:** `recomp_trap` (break/syscall, which are
  Rare's asserts, plus faults in the test build), `recomp_call_external`, and
  `recomp_mfc0`/`recomp_mtc0` (one Status read and one Compare write).
- **Memory layout.** By default memory is a byte-exact big-endian image (what
  the ROM's data is), and every access byte-swaps on the host. That is what
  the test verifies. `-DRECOMP_NATIVE_ENDIAN` switches to host-order words for
  a port whose native C shares those structs. Words, halves and bytes then
  read the same from both sides, but `lwl`/`lwr`/`swl`/`swr` (32 uses) and
  anything that reads one datum at two widths would need checking. Doubles
  and `ld`/`sd` are two words, high word first, in both modes.

How the PC build meets this interface (RDRAM at `0x80000000`, big-endian
memory, the glue generated from the C) is under "Memory model" and "The
glue to the translated code" above.

## Semantics worth knowing

These are the choices where the VR4300, the MIPS spec and QEMU disagree, or
where the obvious C is wrong:

- **`sra`/`srav`** shift the whole 64-bit register and sign-extend the low
  word. Rare does this after `dmult`/`mflo`, so it matters for fixed point.
  QEMU leaves such inputs unextended; the test build follows QEMU there
  (`RECOMP_QEMU_COMPAT`).
- **FR = 0.** Doubles and 64-bit integers are even/odd pairs, and the code
  builds a double with `mtc1 $at, $f9`. The L-format conversions (`cvt.s.l`,
  `cvt.d.l`, `cvt.l.s`, `cvt.l.d`, 44 uses) are legal on the VR4300 with FR =
  0. QEMU rejects them, so the test harness executes those itself.
- **Float to int** out of range or NaN gives `0x7FFFFFFF`/`0x7FFF…F`. `cvt`
  rounds to nearest-even (the FCSR mode the game leaves), with
  `-ffp-contract=off` so nothing fuses.
- **NaNs** follow MIPS legacy encoding: a quiet NaN operand propagates, and a
  signaling NaN or an invalid operation gives `0x7FBFFFFF`. `abs`/`neg`/`mov`
  only touch bits. The FCSR's flag and cause bits aren't kept; nothing but
  libultra's thread switch reads them.
- **`add`/`addi`/`sub`/`dadd`** trap on overflow in the test build and wrap
  in the port. The game never overflows them, since that would crash on
  hardware.
- **Divide by zero** gives the VR4300's result (`LO = n<0 ? 1 : -1`,
  `HI = n`), or QEMU's in the test build. The code only reaches it on paths
  that then `break 7`.

## Running it

```
make -C tools/recomp                  # translate -> blastcorps/build/recomp/src
make -C tools/recomp port             # compile it as the port would (-Werror)
make -C tools/recomp snapshots        # optional: RDRAM from real play (mupen64plus)
make -C tools/recomp test PYTHON=.env/bin/python TRIALS=100
```

These need a built us.v11 stage 2, because the translator reads
`blastcorps/asm/` and `blastcorps/build/*.elf`. The test needs `numpy` and
`unicorn` in the venv. `tools/recomp/analyze.py` prints the opcode
inventory and any control flow the translator would refuse (there is none
now).

### The differential test (`tools/recomp/test/difftest.py`)

Each translated function runs many trials, and each trial does this:

1. Build 4 MB of RDRAM from the linked `hd_code`, `hd_front_end` and `init`
   images, plus one of these fills:
   - one of 8 seeded random fills, mostly zeros, small integers, floats and
     pointers back into RDRAM;
   - one of 16 snapshots of real play. `test/snapshot.c` is a headless
     mupen64plus front-end that is its own scripted input plugin. It plays
     through the title, the name entry, Simian Acres, the pause menu and the
     world map. A snapshot keeps the linked `.text` on top.
2. Randomize the registers the same way. Registers the function
   dereferences before writing them get pointers, taken from pointer-looking
   words of the snapshot when there is one. Words that the code loads from a
   symbol and then dereferences are also given pointers.
3. Run the original in unicorn (MIPS64 big-endian, R4000 model, FR = 0) until
   it returns, traps, or uses up its budget of 400k instructions.
4. Reset memory and run the translated C, built into a shared library with
   `RECOMP_TEST`, on the same state. Calls out of it run the original callee
   in unicorn on the same buffer. So everything that isn't translated
   executes identically in both runs, which is also why `hd_code`'s C doesn't
   need to be available as C here. A second pass (`--stub-externs`) makes
   every callee return a hash of its arguments in both runs instead, which
   gets further into code whose callees fault on random state.
5. Compare all GPRs, HI/LO, all 32 FPR words, the FCSR condition bit, every
   byte of RDRAM, and how the run ended (return, break, syscall, overflow,
   or address fault). Code pages are write-protected in both runs, so
   random pointers can't rewrite instructions that only the original would
   then execute.

A trial where either side hit the budget is inconclusive. So is one where
the random state overwrote the saved `$ra` (the translated code refuses to
return anywhere but its caller). `--trace FUNC:TRIAL` with the
`librecomp_trace.so` build (`make trace-lib`) replays one trial with a
per-instruction register trace on both sides and prints where they diverge.

### Results (100 trials per function, with snapshots)

- **688/688 functions pass.** Across both passes, 0 of about 137,000 trials
  differ.
- 548 functions returned normally in at least one trial, and 584 when
  callees are stubbed. The other 104 only ever faulted or trapped,
  identically on both sides, which still compares state up to the fault.
  100 of those dereference a register or global that neither the random
  state nor the snapshots make valid: 62 null or small-integer pointers and
  38 other bad addresses. Of the last four, one always overflows, one
  always faults on alignment, one always runs past the budget, and one is
  an assert (`syscall`, hd_front_end's `func_80202100`) that always fires.
- Coverage of the translated code, over both passes: 69.4% of basic blocks
  (6385 of 9203) and 75.7% of instructions executed at least once. All 102
  opcodes the code uses are executed.
- Mutation check: of 11 bugs planted in the runtime or the translator (slti
  signedness, sra as logical, `lb` zero-extending, `cvt.w.s` truncating,
  mult HI/LO swapped, dmult HI dropped, `c.le` as `c.lt`, `lwr` shift,
  `swl` bytes, branch condition read after the delay slot), the test catches
  10, each with 2 to 188 failing functions. The eleventh, `lwl` keeping the
  wrong low bytes, is masked by the code: every `lwl` is paired with an
  `lwr` that overwrites those bytes.

What this can't test:

- Code that reads hardware or needs another thread (libultra's message
  queues) only gets as far as its first fault in these runs.
- The other 30% of the blocks were never reached. Getting there
  needs realistic arguments, not only realistic memory.
- Undefined-behaviour cases where QEMU and the VR4300 differ (`sra` on
  unextended values, divide by zero) are checked against QEMU's behaviour in
  the test build. The port build's VR4300 behaviour for them is not
  exercised.
